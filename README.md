Hi, welcome to MMXXV. This is a fun game to see who has the best prediction chops. Here's how it works:

///ADD description here.


Point Sytem:
Users gain point in three ways:

1. Voting: 1 point
2. Posing a top 25 question: 20 points
3. Correctly predicting the outcome of an event: varies (explained below).

   VOTING:
   Users will pose questions that have a definite yes or no answer (e.g. Taylor swift before the end of the year of our Lord, 2025.
   These questions will be submitted to the website before January 20, 2025.
   Between now, January 5, 2025 and the 20th, users will upvote the questions they find interesting and downvote the ones they don't.
   They will get 1 point for each vote they place.

   POSING A TOP 25 QUESTION
   Of all the questions submitted, the ones with the most votes on midnight January 20th (EST), will enter the prediction pool for the year.
   The authors of these questions will each be awarded 20 points.

   CORRECTLY PREDICTING THE OUTCOME OF AN EVENT
   The questions:

   here is the formula for getting it right:
   if you get the question right
   points = max(100, 5/x) where x is the money line of the prediction.

   if you get the question wrong:
   penalty = max(50, 2/x)

   The winner of the game is the user with the most points summed across all predictions.
